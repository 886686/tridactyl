            <p>You're seeing this page because Tridactyl thinks you ran the <span class="special">fixamo</span> command at some point. This command changed two preferences in your <span class="special">user.js</span> file: <span class="special">extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains</span> and <span class="special">privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager</span>. Mozilla reviewers think these settings are very dangerous and should never be changed by end users. They gave Tridactyl maintainers an ultimatum: either remove the command and the changes it made to user's files before october 2019 or be blocked.</p>
            <p>Tridactyl maintainers reluctantly complied and Tridactyl has restored the <span class="special">restrictedDomains</span> preference to its original value in your <span class="special">user.js</span>. It also added a new preference named <span class="special">tridactyl.unfixedamo</span> in order to know that it shouldn't touch your <span class="special">extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains</span> setting ever again.</p>
