# Settings

The Tridactyl settings are currently undergoing change; there will eventually be an `options` page where you can change and view these settings.

Currently, you can view settings on `help` next to the commands that they affect, or with `get [setting]`. You can set a setting with `set`, and reset it to default with `unset`. `bind [key] [command]` is a helper command that sets settings within nmaps.

Here we will briefly summarise some of the main settings:

- nmaps
    - these are all of the keybinds in normal mode
- searchengine
    - the default search engine to use. You can choose any from the searchurls setting, or add your own.
- hintfiltermode
    - the style of hint mode to use. Set it to "vimperator" to filter links by typing in the text they display
    - You will also want to change the hintchars setting to something that allows you to type in most text, e.g, 5432167890.
- theme
    - dark or default

The <a href='./help.html' rel='next'>final page</a> describes how you can get further help.
