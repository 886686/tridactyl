# Normal mode tutorial

Normal mode is where you will spend most of your time.

You can scroll up and down pages using `k` and `j`, and left and right with `h` and `l`.

You can repeat the last action with `.`.

Many keypresses in normal mode take you into another mode. `t`, for example, puts you into command mode prefilled with the command for opening a new tab; `F` puts you into hinting mode to open a link in a background tab; `gi` focuses the first text box on the page and allows you to press `Tab` to switch between text boxes.

All the keys in normal mode are bound to commands; for example, `j` is bound to `scrolline 10`. If you are ever curious as to what a key sequence does in normal mode, you can simply use `:bind [keys]` and the command line will tell you to which command they are bound.

The [next page](./hint_mode.html) will explain how to use some of the various hint modes.
