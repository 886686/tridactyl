# Getting help

You can get help about any command by typing `help [command]` in command mode. Additionally, 

- If you want to know what a key is bound to, you can simply type `bind [key]` and you will be told the ex command.
- If you want to know the value of a setting, `get [setting]`, for example `get nmaps`.

Lastly, you can contact the developers via Matrix or GitHub, as mentioned on the new tab page.

This concludes the tutorial. If you have any feedback, please leave it on [the relevant GitHub issue](https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl/issues/380).
