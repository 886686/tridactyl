##Control your browser with your keyboard *only*.

Replace Firefox's control mechanism with one modelled on VIM.

**Highlighted features:**

 - modes: Use Firefox in different modes like normal-mode, hint-mode or ex-mode
 - hint-mode: Follow any link on the site just with a few key presses.
 - `buffer`: switch to any open tab with searching for it's URL or title.
 - easy customizable search settings
 - persistent custom bindings and configuration
 - great default bindings (if you're used to Pentadactyl or Vimperator)

This addon is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend to
implement the majority of Vimperator's features.

We recommend that you use the beta versions below.
