# Tridactyl news - Spring 2021

<!-- WIP -->

Hello,

Welcome to the seventh quarterly Tridactyl newsletter.


<!-- As a gentle reminder, the second (and first paywalled) Tridactyl top-tips newsletter will be going out in the next few days. If you'd like to receive it, simply up your monthly pledge to 10 USD or more on GitHub sponsors (preferred, as I get ~30%+ more of your money after taxes and transaction fees) or Patreon. I really appreciate every penny you send - it directly affects how long I can afford to work on Tridactyl. This next tips newsletter will be on making custom themes.-->

## Highlighted new features


## Neat bug fixes


## Plans for next few months

As a small note - submission of new beta builds has been suspended by Mozilla for about three weeks now, "pending review". I'll keep you updated once we know more. The stable builds are unaffected so we may end up in the strange situation where our beta builds are older than our stable builds if it goes on for long enough.

As always, thanks for your generous support,

bovine3dom and the rest of the Tridactyl developers
